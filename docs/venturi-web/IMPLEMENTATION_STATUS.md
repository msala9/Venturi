# Implementation status

2026-10-20 — development branch feat/venturi-web.

## G0

Complete source and screenshot audit against b3b03bf. Installer copied 37
files without conflicts; original root agent rules preserved. See G0_REPORT
and SCREENSHOT_AUDIT for evidence and limitations. Functional parity ledger
updated with source paths. Runtime baseline pending dependency installation;
The initial WSL GPU limitation is resolved for exact-frame acceptance by the
halo2 measurements recorded under M3a below.

Subsequent milestones and exact verification results are recorded below.

## M1a — web shell

Implemented native HTML/CSS/ES modules, four workspace layouts, browser tabs,
honest disabled advanced tool homes, command palette, Projects dialog,
export integration notice, fullscreen, resizable keyboard-accessible panels,
local layout preferences and labeled Shot/Take fixtures. Node shortcut test
passes. Browser checked at 1920x1080 and 1280x800; four workspace screenshots
and compact layout saved under evidence/m1-*.jpg. Keyboard splitter increased
260 to 276; text input accepted Space without editor transport action;
command palette focus was verified. No engine capability claimed by shell.

## M1b — Canvas timeline

Implemented rational frame coordinates, visible-range culling, DPR scaling,
rAF invalidation, pointer capture, snap, local move/trim ghosts, overlap/lock
feedback, linked selection, marquee, pan, pointer-anchored zoom, fit, frame
stepping and an accessible DOM clip list. The 500-clip fixture was loaded and
rendered in the Windows in-app browser at 1280x800 (evidence/m1b-timeline-1280.jpg).
Six Node tests pass, including 24000/1001 and 30000/1001 coordinate roundtrips,
collision/lock cases, linked IDs, exactly one commit on release, zero commands
on pointermove and cancellation on Escape/capture loss. Fixture mutations
are refused explicitly; no browser editing engine/persistence is introduced.
60 fps and Windows 125/150% scaling benchmarks remain unverified.

## M2a — native HTTP host

Implemented vv-web with Axum/Tokio, embedded first-party assets, normalized
errors, loopback-only CLI, Host/Origin checks, request limits, CSP/nosniff,
bounded session actor and native snapshots. Core native project/command
services and their focused tests were included together so their ownership
and serialization boundary are concrete; browser integration is recorded in
M2b/M2c. The eight original default workspace members are preserved.

Verified: cargo check -p vv-session and -p vv-web passed. Native baseline:
250 vv-core tests passed; 98 vv-session tests passed, 1 upstream test ignored;
9 vv-web tests passed. Graphics-related baseline tests used WSL llvmpipe,
not AMD hardware. The new tests cover HTTP boundaries, native import, atomic
save/backup/symlink refusal, collision refusal, linked/locked edits, history,
idempotency, epoch/generation conflicts and writer ownership. Browser health
and project creation/import were exercised against the real host.

Environment: Rust 1.99.1, FFmpeg 8.0.1 with libavdevice/libavfilter headers,
ALSA and clang. WSL was terminated once by its init lifecycle during the
first check attempt; persistent cache logs and foreground PTY execution were
used on the successful retry. Clippy found one manual-range style issue,
which was corrected; the final rerun is recorded below.

## M2b — project/session workflow

The browser is connected to authoritative native session snapshots. Verified
in the real host: create, save, process restart, reopen the saved RON, import
synthetic H.264/AAC media, insert linked video/audio and retain native IDs.
The project chooser uses server-issued root filenames; no arbitrary filesystem
browser. Saved .vvproj.bak is available for previous-save recovery. Save As,
nested roots, uploads, automatic crash recovery and asynchronous import probing
remain unimplemented (see RUNNING.md). A browser reload may wait for the prior
writer lease to expire; Reconnect reacquires it safely.

The M2b browser integration commit also carries the bounded exact-frame service
for the next milestone, with capability disabled unless an explicit AMD Vulkan
device initializes. Target GPU acceptance is recorded separately after testing;
code existence does not imply GPU validation.

## M2c — safe command bridge

Implemented native safe move, linked move/trim, split, lift/global ripple delete,
undo/redo, safe media/generator insertion and track add/mute/solo/lock. Numeric
trim uses explicit Apply controls; Alt+Left/Right moves the linked selection by
one frame (Shift adds ten). Each gesture sends one revisioned command, with
native history grouping. Local ghosts never write to the server. Overlap,
locked tracks, incomplete linked moves and stale revisions are refused before
mutation. Markers, clip disable, fades and general property editing remain
unimplemented; their parity rows stay open.

Verified native roundtrips for paired move, paired trim and global ripple,
including exactly one undo and unchanged revision/history on refusal. Browser
verified import/linked insertion, numeric trim 48 to 36 frames and undo, save,
and occupied-generator refusal without changing the two existing clips.
Evidence: m2-native-project-1920.jpg and m2-overlap-rejected.jpg. Pointer drag
commit and 60fps under load still need real-browser performance validation;
the gesture state machine is covered by Node tests, not a timing claim.

## M3a — actual headless composed frames

Validated on halo2 Ubuntu 26.04.1, AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700 (RADV GFX1201),
vendor/device 1002:7551, PCI 67:00.0, Vulkan, Mesa 26.0.8-1ubuntu0.3. Strix Halo
1002:1586 at 68:00.0 is enumerated separately and was not selected. No desktop
environment is required. Only the user-authorized Vulkan userspace and
multimedia dependencies were installed: zero existing packages upgraded,
no kernel AMD driver, ROCm or inference configuration changes.

The native composed fixture includes H.264 video plus a 60%-opacity scaled
solid on a second track with keyframed position. HTTP PNG frames 0, 12 and 36,
decoded to RGBA, exactly match independent native render_frame_rgba output:
2,073,600 bytes each. Screenshot m3-r9700-composed-preview.jpg shows CURRENT
in the Windows browser through the SSH tunnel. Native render identity and
hashes are recorded in evidence/m3-r9700-validation.json.

500 sequential seeks over 59.97 seconds: 500 successful, zero errors,
loopback HTTP p50 96.43 ms / p95 113.64 ms at 960x540, 24fps timeline. These
are server fetch latencies, not browser presentation latency or playback fps.
The input source is 320x180, composed in a 1920x1080 timeline; this is not a
1080p-source throughput benchmark. A post-run snapshot measured server RSS
50,728 KiB and total R9700 VRAM use 272,642,048 bytes, GPU busy 0%; neither is
a peak or a Venturi-only VRAM measurement. No two-hour soak or A/V sync proof.

Every uncached render and GPU initialization takes the laboratory's shared
/tmp/HALO_BENCHMARK.lock nonblocking. A foreign inference owner was observed:
Venturi returned GPU_BUSY, then validation proceeded after release. Foreign
processes, ports and model services were preserved. No concurrent inference
performance claim is made. RADV warns that this device is not a conformant
Vulkan implementation and is for testing; this is development validation.

Frame service bounds: one running and one replaceable pending job, eight
cached images / 16 MiB, maximum 4,194,304 output pixels. Browser aborts old
requests, rejects obsolete epoch/generation/revision/frame/width and labels
retained images stale. Out-of-order fetches and GPU_BUSY are covered by Node
tests; pending-job replacement and resolution caps by Rust tests.

Final local checks: 13 vv-web tests, 10 JavaScript tests, cargo fmt --all
-- --check, clippy -p vv-web --all-targets -- -D warnings, and build passed.
The unchanged desktop vv-app check passed; baseline native suites remain
250 vv-core and 98 vv-session passed, one upstream session test ignored.
M1 timing/DPI acceptance and M3b–M7 remain open. See PREVIEW_SPIKE.md for
the smallest next media increment and measured constraints.

Deployment/browser follow-up: the final embedded UI binary was deployed during
an idle lock slot, replacing only the verified Venturi PID on 127.0.0.1:8790.
Windows browser confirmed Alt+Right start 0 to 1, undo back to 0, split at 12,
redo, lift delete and two undos restoring original revision e3c0f15b. The restored
fixture was saved. Screenshot records CURRENT at frame 12. An external Rust
test also verifies immediate GPU_BUSY under occupied lock and that the shared
lock file is preserved.

## M3b — source playback, thumbnails and waveforms

Implemented on-demand native all-intra H.264/AAC MP4 source preparation,
including the first audio stream and audio-only media. The new vv-media
browser_proxy adapter reuses native proxy, audio decode and AAC writing, then
muxes through FFmpeg library bindings. Production does not spawn ffmpeg CLI.
The existing desktop proxy path and decoder defaults are preserved. Web video
decode/encode and thumbnails use two CPU threads, no GPU or Linux audio sink.

A single background worker plus one queued source job owns private staged
outputs. Repeated requests deduplicate by project epoch, media ID, source file
identity and quality/version. Completed assets require the current epoch and
the same source identity on every request. Source handles use root-relative
NOFOLLOW opens. Changed/offline media and cross-project IDs cannot retrieve
cached material. Cache is bounded to 2 GiB and approximately 24 completed jobs;
one staging job adds up to 512 MiB. Entries can be evicted and regenerated.
Cache is process-local, stored in an owned private temporary directory and
removed on orderly worker shutdown. Crash-orphan cleanup remains M7 work.

Current bounds: regular sources up to ten minutes, dimensions at most 8192,
ten-minute job wall budget, 512 MiB job output and 256 MiB of decoded f32 audio
samples (native AAC staging/copies add temporary memory). This bounded version
does not claim unrestricted long-file support. Still-image Source, audio
stream selection and persistent disk cache recovery remain open.

Browser: media double-click or Source opens preparation; native video controls
play/seek with sound in the Windows browser. Source quality Low/Medium/High,
cancel, frame stepping and stale-open cancellation are implemented. Source
transport is independent from the Program playhead. On-demand thumbnail and
native waveform peaks appear in the media panel and Canvas, with a bounded
32 MiB / 16-entry browser asset cache. No timeline edit RPC runs on pointermove.

halo2 synthetic H.264/AAC, 48 frames 320x180 24fps: High preparation 102.59 ms,
224,874-byte MP4, H.264 High YUV420P + AAC LC 48kHz mono. Video duration 2.000 s,
audio 2.005 s; complete decode passed. HTTP prefix/suffix requests returned
correct bytes and 206; invalid range 416; stale project epoch 409. Thumbnail
PNG and 200 waveform peaks were verified. Windows Chromium reported playing,
readyState 4, 320x180, 2.005-second duration, muted=false and advancing time.
This is a short feasibility fixture, not long-form A/V drift proof or a
physical-speaker measurement. Evidence: m3b-halo2-source-validation.json and
m3b-source-audio-browser.jpg.

Checks: 17 vv-web tests and 11 JavaScript tests passed; vv-media suite passed
107 tests with two existing ignored tests when run serially. A parallel run
hit the upstream encoder color-check temporary-name race; serial execution
avoids that existing shared-file collision. New coverage includes actual A/V and
audio-only proxy decode, cancellation, job deduplication, epoch/media/file
identity isolation, Range/If-Range and obsolete browser preparations. Clippy,
formatting, native desktop check and vv-web build passed. Program playback,
export and advanced feature parity remain subsequent work, not completed by
source playback.

## M3c implementation checkpoint — GPU acceptance pending

Program preparation now reuses the native bounded decode/compose/encode and
offline audio-mix pipeline, with an explicit compositor factory and per-stage
GPU permits. The original desktop export entry point retains its defaults.
Web permits wait for submitted GPU work before unlocking, including unwinding;
local GPU workers serialize before trying the shared laboratory lock. Web CPU
decode and x264 encode use two threads. Preview ranges are currently capped
at five minutes, ten-minute preparation time and 512 MiB output.

The media worker now serves source and Program jobs with one running and one
pending item, progress, cancellation and Range delivery. Program identity
includes epoch, generation, native revision, range, requested quality and used
source-file identities. Status/download revalidate the document and media.
Cancellation remains possible after the document revision changes. Only fully
finalized MP4 files become ready. Browser playback rejects superseded seeks,
uses media presentation time for the playhead and polls document validity.

CPU/local checks: 19 vv-web tests, 13 JavaScript tests and native session suite
99 passed / 1 upstream ignored. A focused native test verifies eight permit
entries/releases for four decoded/composed frames and decodable native output.
WSL graphics tests use software rendering; they are not R9700 evidence.
Clippy for vv-web/vv-media/vv-session and formatting passed. Target GPU playback,
color comparison, long-form A/V timing and actual encoder-stage measurements
remain unverified; M3c is not accepted yet.

Resource handoff: D41 requested priority for EP2 inference. Venturi stopped its
GPU process and restarted only its own web service without --gpu-device.
Verified no /dev/dri or /dev/kfd handles and approximately 51 MiB server RSS.
No foreign workload was stopped. Hardware testing stays suspended until D41
confirms release; CPU development continues locally. D41 confirmed its workers
exited at 12:36:37 UTC; a subsequent check found H3 holding the shared lock.
Re-enable only Venturi's GPU option during a verified free slot. Exact preview
now drops its compositor after two idle seconds; Program owns its compositor
only during preparation. Diagnostics report context residency separately from
hardware capability. Actual device-handle release still needs hardware proof.

## M3b additional Source coverage — PNG/JPEG stills

Source now serves a private bounded copy of an imported PNG/JPEG original,
without transcoding its color profile or alpha. Signature validation, native
image probing and source identity checks precede publication; copying observes
cancellation and the 512 MiB budget. Other still formats remain unavailable in
Source. Native thumbnails remain preview conversions, not color references.
Play/step/quality controls are disabled for stills. Browser proof: imported
320x180 RGBA PNG displayed at natural size with an inactive transport, saved
project, screenshot evidence/m3b-still-source-browser.png. Original PNG bytes
including alpha compare exactly in the native job test. All 20 web Rust tests,
14 JavaScript tests, formatting and clippy passed.

## M4 independent increment — native properties and scalar keyframes

While shared GPU acceptance is unavailable, CPU-only Edit work adds a guarded
clip-detail read and atomic native property commands. Inspector covers all 13
transform/crop/opacity parameters, flip, all 15 native blend modes, four matte
modes plus none, solid/title RGBA, audio gain and clip fades. Each patch validates
all fields and track locks before a single native composite command; undo
restores the whole patch. Native static/default and evaluated values remain
distinct. Scalar transform/gain keyframes use native source-frame conversion,
upsert/remove and interpolation. The UI exposes five interpolation presets;
validated Bezier control points are supported by the API, not a curve editor.
No JavaScript evaluation of effects or interpolation was added.

Windows browser verification: PositionX 0→48→undo 0; opacity source keyframes
0=75 Linear and 1=50 EaseInOut persisted with Save. Screenshot:
evidence/m4-native-inspector-browser.png. All 22 Rust web tests, 16 JavaScript
tests, formatting, clippy and web build passed. Focused native tests cover
all-or-nothing validation, one-step undo/redo, lock refusal, source-frame mapping,
invalid ranges and keyframe removal/interpolation undo. GPU rendering of these
new edits is pending the shared hardware slot. M4 as a whole remains open:
transitions, masks, curves, slip, markers, speed, presets and compounds are not
claimed complete by this increment.

## M4 independent increment — Source range, linked slip and markers

Source In/Out uses exclusive integer source-frame bounds, local I/O buttons
and numeric fields; insertion still uses native FPS conforming and safe
overlap validation. Selected clips expose native link/unlink, enable/disable
and numeric linked slip. Slip validates the source handles and lock of every
linked member before one atomic history entry. The dedicated dual-frame Slip
viewer and pointer slip tool remain unimplemented.

Marker add/edit/remove uses native timeline IDs and commands, bounded note/range
validation and undo. Markers have native palette colors, ruler ranges and
existing timeline snapping. Inspector provides marker editing and jump; drag
of a marker is not implemented. Literal note text uses safe DOM/Canvas APIs.

Browser proof: Source 6–18 inserted a linked 12-frame video/audio pair. Slip +1
changed both source ranges to 7–19 with unchanged start 0 and length 12. Saved
and reloaded the project successfully; the writer ID now persists in tab
session storage, fixing the reload lease wait found during validation. Marker
12–18 with note Cut cue applied and saved. Screenshots:
evidence/m4-source-range-linked-slip-browser.png and
evidence/m4-native-markers-browser.png. Native tests cover source bounds,
linked slip/refusal/lock/undo, group disable/unlink/undo and marker CRUD/undo.
All 23 Rust web tests, 18 JavaScript tests, clippy and build passed.

M3c fixtures are ready on halo2: GPU_composed_AV.vvproj (native linked A/V plus
animated composited solid) and GPU_sync_5m.vvproj (7200 frames at 24fps, five
white flashes and 100ms beeps at 0/60/120/180/240 seconds). They are test inputs,
not successful hardware results. Shared lock remained busy; no GPU job ran.

## M3c local five-minute validation and native encoder correction

An actual 7200-frame native export on WSL llvmpipe found that missing video
packet durations made the MP4 edit list discard the final reordered frame:
7199 decoded, duration 299.958 seconds. The shared native encoder now sets the
one-frame duration only when a video packet omitted it, before time-base
rescaling. The existing encoder test now requires the exact frame count rather
than accepting loss of one frame. Audio packet behavior is unchanged.

The repeated native export decoded all 7200 frames, H.264 640x360 at 24fps and
48kHz stereo AAC. Video duration 300.000s; AAC padded duration 300.010s.
All five flash/beep onsets differ by one audio sample (0.0005 video frame),
with no accumulating drift through 240s. Preparation took 58.54s for this
deliberately simple synthetic composition; this is CPU/llvmpipe evidence,
not R9700 throughput or physical speaker/browser sync proof. Detailed evidence:
evidence/m3c-cpu-five-minute-sync.json. Reproduction uses the verify_preview
fixture_sync/export modes and scripts/venturi-web-validate-sync.py. Full M3c
GPU/browser acceptance still awaits a shared hardware slot; D41 announced a
further priority 60–90 minute quality test after the current H3 video.
