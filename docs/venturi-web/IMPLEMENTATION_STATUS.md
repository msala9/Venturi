# Implementation status

2026-10-20 — development branch feat/venturi-web.

## G0

Complete source and screenshot audit against b3b03bf. Installer copied 37
files without conflicts; original root agent rules preserved. See G0_REPORT
and SCREENSHOT_AUDIT for evidence and limitations. Functional parity ledger
updated with source paths. Runtime baseline pending dependency installation;
GPU-specific acceptance remains blocked on verified target hardware.

Subsequent milestones and exact verification results are recorded below.

## M1a — web shell

Implemented native HTML/CSS/ES modules, four workspace layouts, browser tabs,
honest disabled advanced tool homes, command palette, Projects dialog,
export integration notice, fullscreen, resizable keyboard-accessible panels,
local layout preferences and labeled Shot/Take fixtures. Node shortcut test
passes. Browser checked at 1920x1080 and 1280x800; four workspace screenshots
and compact layout saved under evidence/m1-*.jpg. Keyboard splitter increased
260 to 276; text input accepted Space without editor transport action;
command palette focus was verified. No engine capability claimed by shell.

## M1b — Canvas timeline

Implemented rational frame coordinates, visible-range culling, DPR scaling,
rAF invalidation, pointer capture, snap, local move/trim ghosts, overlap/lock
feedback, linked selection, marquee, pan, pointer-anchored zoom, fit, frame
stepping and an accessible DOM clip list. The 500-clip fixture was loaded and
rendered in the Windows in-app browser at 1280x800 (evidence/m1b-timeline-1280.jpg).
Six Node tests pass, including 24000/1001 and 30000/1001 coordinate roundtrips,
collision/lock cases, linked IDs, exactly one commit on release, zero commands
on pointermove and cancellation on Escape/capture loss. Fixture mutations
are refused explicitly; no browser editing engine/persistence is introduced.
60 fps and Windows 125/150% scaling benchmarks remain unverified.
